The past century has seen the most spectacular discoveries and theoretical developments in fundamental physics. The unification of quantum mechanics and special relativity led to the framework of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) as the idea that our Universe is traversed by fields vibrating in a certain harmony, together materialising the macroscopic world around us. It was this paradigm shift of realising that the fundamental objects of nature are not the humongous number of particles, but rather a handful of fields, that stimulated significant strides. In fact, it led us to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics which unifies three fundamental forces and characterises all elementary particles. While the framework of QFT allows us to describe infinitely many particles as concentrations of energy in fields, there is still little known about the actual number and precise configuration of such fields persisting in the real world. For years, theoretical physicists have derived strong constraints on extensions of our best theoretical models of nature, though no unique direction has so far been singled out. Ultimately, the utmost goal remains a theory describing nature at arbitrarily small length scales; a property referred to as ultra-violet completeness. A key obstacle nowadays remains developing a clear understanding of the ultra-violet limit of Effective Field Theories (EFTs) coupled to gravity.

Over the past decades, string theory has emerged as a viable candidate for a ultra-violet (UV) complete theory of quantum gravity. In essence, by assuming that the fundamental objects of nature are 1-dimensional vibrating objects, it unifies an infinite number of fields in abstract spaces of dimension 10. There are five string theories in 10 dimensions which are certain limits of a unifying theory referred to as M-theory. In the process of relating string theory to our observed 4-dimensional Universe, the theory becomes inherently entangled with compact geometries, i.e., higher dimensional generalisations of spheres in the context of so-called string compactifications. That is, the theory needs to be reduced on a compact 6-dimensional manifold X by expanding fields into Fourier modes and keeping only the lightest degrees of freedom. Although challenging, the requirement for reducing the theory on a compact space gives a brilliant way of thinking about the unification of forces. Just like Einstein described gravitation as the curvature of 4-dimensional spacetime, there were early attempts to unify all forces of nature by investigating curvature in higher-dimensions as early as the 1920s. Although these models were partially successful, the absence of an intrinsic motivation and interpretation of the proposed extra dimensions rendered this idea void. It was brought back to life about 50 years later when extra dimensions were discovered to appear naturally in string theory.

Depending on the perspective, the existence of extra dimensions can be viewed as a blessing or a curse. The plethora of degeneracies involved in making the theory effectively 4-dimensional gives rise to a colossal string theory landscape of valid EFTs, only one of which is believed to describe our Universe. Estimates on its size range from 10<sup>500</sup> to 10<sup>272,000</sup> with each solution characterising a distinct universe. It is the result of a great number of massless scalar fields, called moduli, characterising the size and shape of X. Mathematically speaking, they are associated with variations of the Kähler and complex structure of X at every point in the four non-compact dimensions. Since they would lead to unwanted observable long-range effects in 4D, they must gain large masses due to a dynamically generated potential. This procedure is conveniently referred to as moduli stabilisation. Having proper control over quantum effects in string theory is typically a requisite for tackling issues related to moduli stabilisation. Because the physics in 4-dimensional spacetime is highly affected by procedure’s outcome, these challenges are of utmost importance for addressing phenomenological questions in string theory.

The main argument for the study of string theory remains its potential to explain all natural phenomena, including gravity, within a consistent quantum framework. A central tenet of my research is uncovering novel mechanisms in string theory and its compactifications from methodical analyses of symmetries, dualities and geometries.
