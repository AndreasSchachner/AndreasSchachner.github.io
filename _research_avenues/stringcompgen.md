The past century has seen the most spectacular discoveries and theoretical develop- ments in fundamental physics. We discovered that curvature of spacetime encodes the force of gravitation, while quantum mechanics allowed us to describe nature at the sub-atomic level. On top of that, one of the most successful frameworks in theoretical physics emerged going by the name of quantum field theory (QFT). The idea is that our world is traversed by fields whose excitations are perceived as particles. These fields vibrate in a certain harmony to materialise the observed macroscopic world. The language of field theory has proven in- credibly useful in deciphering nature to an astonishing level of precision. The most successful application of QFT is without a doubt the Standard Model of particle physics which has been confirmed in countless experiments. It unifies the three fundamental forces and characterises all elementary particles building the framework for the formation of atoms, molecules and other particles. The combined efforts of theoretical and experimental research culminated in its final completion with the discovery of the Higgs in 2012.

On the opposite end of scales, the study of cosmology led to the Î›CDM-Model describing the evolution of our universe from the first fractions of a second after the Big-Bang until today. Among its many accomplishments is the accurate explanation of the anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and thereby also of the distribution of galaxies in our universe. The CMB is a snapshot of the universe from about 380.000 years after the Big-Bang when the first atoms formed and the universe suddenly became transparent. It is an incredible achievement to not only practically measure, but also theoretically explain the spread of signals to such a degree of accuracy. This is quite literally a way to look back in time and comprehend the earliest stages of the universe from first principles.

Given these successes, where is research on fundamental physics heading towards? Since the early days of theoretical sciences, there is a persistent quest for even smaller length or, equivalently, higher energy scales. In fact, the history of physics might equally well be understood as a progression of scales summarised in Fig. 1.1. Today, we appreciate how matter is formed from even smaller constituents like molecules and atoms. Both are again made up from tinier building blocks such as electrons and protons. At the smallest sub-atomic scales, quarks have been confirmed as the elementary particles forming protons and other hadrons. Theoretically, this is understood through a set of strong mathematical constraints on the Standard Model particles going by the name of anomaly cancellation conditions that guarantee the stable formation of matter. Put simply, they explain the exact match of electric charge of electron and proton which is not a result by means of any type of approximation. For future extensions of the theory, these conditions constitute guidelines by restricting among others the type and number of particles. Ultimately, the utmost goal of fundamental physics remains a theory describing nature at arbitrarily small length scales; a property referred to as ultra-violet (UV) completeness. In this context, the natural question is whether there are even smaller elementary objects that are responsible for nature as we know it.
