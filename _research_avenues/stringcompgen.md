The optimal testing ground to search for new physics is embodied by the early stages of the universe. To shed light into the beginning of our universe, a unified theory probing all energy scales is advantageous in many respects. In fact, a full quantum theory of gravity coupled to the known Standard Model physics stands out as the biggest lack in our description of nature. Even though treating gravity as an effective quantum theory is viable up to the Planck scale âˆ¼ 10<sup>19</sup> GeV, a complete understanding of quantum gravity remains so far out of reach. Over the past decades, string theory has emerged as a viable candidate for a ultra-violet (UV) complete theory of quantum gravity. Indeed, it allows us to address fundamental challenges of cosmology and particle physics, especially the period before inflation and thereby possibly its origin in the early universe.
