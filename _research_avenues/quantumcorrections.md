Effective field theories (EFTs) have been the subject of recent debates regarding their relative importance for a UV complete theory of gravity. On the one hand, based on the outstanding success of EFTs to describe all kinds of physical phenomena, a common bottom-up attitude is to fully concentrate on EFTs at low-energies assuming that their self-consistency is enough to expect that they can be completed in the UV. On the other hand, the swampland programme argues that most EFTs cannot be UV completed, and concentrates on conjectures that could eliminate general classes of EFTs.

My interests concern an alternative, more traditional, top-down approach by performing systematic studies of α′ corrections to the 4D effective action of compactified string theories which automatically provide a UV completion. Extracting reliable low-energy information from string compactifications notoriously requires a detailed understanding of the UV sensitivity of the corresponding EFTs. Despite past efforts in computing perturbative string corrections to the tree-level action, neither a systematic approach nor a unified framework has emerged yet.

Hereby, I'm following several strategies:
