## Applications to the String Landscape

While the string landscape encompasses a vast number of low energy effective field theories, only a small subset of them are phenomenologically viable. The enormous size of the landscape makes exhaustic searches or random samplings impractical. In fact, the computational complexity of finding string vacua was argued to be NP hard, though the search for phenomenological attractive vacua can be sped up with more sophisticated optimisation algorithms. Topological features of the landscape suggest a more orderly structure than a random potential. Thus, it remains a top challenge to design efficicient optimization methods to search for realistic vacua that may at the same time reveal the hidden structure of the landscape.

To circumvent the computational complexity of the landscape, stochastic optimisation such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have been used to tackle the landscape. Despite progress, state-of-the-art algorithms in purposeful searches of string vacua are still rather inefficient. Hence, I am particularly interested in developing further these approaches and contrast their performances.

Further, 
boundaries

Building upon that, such analyses are effective in revealing non-trivial correlations in and determining boundaries of physical parameter spaces which is particularly attractive in the context of the landscape-swampland program. 

My vision is that this paradigm shift will set new impulses for continuing progress in advancing our understanding of UV properties of EFTs.
