I am a PhD in Theoretical Physics focussing on string theory and its compactifications. Currently, I am working on constructing local effective actions from string theory including higher derivative and string loop corrections in 10 dimensions. Further, I am interested in understanding the systematics of Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications, in particular an SL(2,Z) invariant framework. This includes the derivation of novel N=1 quantum corrections to the 4-dimensional effective action. 

I am also interested in applications of machine learning to fundamental physics.
