   <p align="justify"> I am a PhD in Theoretical Physics focussing on string theory and its compactifications. My research interests include in particular string phenomenology, quantum gravity, cosmology and non-perturbative aspects of QFT. I am also interested in applications of machine learning to fundamental physics. </p>
