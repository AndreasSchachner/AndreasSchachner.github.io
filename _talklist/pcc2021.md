### Title: The Standard Model Quiver in de Sitter String Compactifications

### Abstract:

With the advent of the string landscape, the realisation of the Standard Model in general string theory compactifications to 4D has become a primary focus. This talk concerns novel constructions of the Standard Model in global set-ups of type IIB Calabi-Yau compactifications. We argue that the Standard Model quiver can be embedded into compact Calabi-Yau geometries through orientifolded D3-branes at del Pezzo singularities dPùëõ with n ‚â• 5 in a framework including moduli stabilisation. To illustrate our approach, we explicitly construct a local dP5 model via a combination of Higgsing and orientifolding. This procedure reduces the original dP5 quiver gauge theory to the Left-Right symmetric model with three families of quarks and leptons as well as a Higgs sector to further break the symmetries to the Standard Model gauge group. We embed this local model in a globally consistent Calabi-Yau flux compactification with tadpole and Freed-Witten anomaly cancellations. The model features closed string moduli stabilisation with a de Sitter minimum from T-branes, supersymmetry broken by the K√§hler moduli, and the MSSM as the low energy spectrum. We further discuss phenomenological and cosmological implications of this construction.
