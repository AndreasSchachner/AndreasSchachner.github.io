### Title: Probing the Structure of String Theory Vacua with Genetic Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning

### Abstract:

Identifying string theory vacua with desired physical properties at low energies requires searching through high-dimensional solution spaces -- collectively referred to as the string landscape. We highlight that this search problem is amenable to reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms. In the context of flux vacua, we are able to reveal novel features (suggesting previously unidentified symmetries) in the string theory solutions required for properties such as the string coupling. In order to identify these features robustly, we combine results from both search methods, which we argue is imperative for reducing sampling bias.
